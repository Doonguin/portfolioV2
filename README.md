# PortfolioV2
I don't know how many times I have tried to make a good portfolio website, but this is yet another attempt at it.

## Things that need to be in this portfolio
After thinking for like, two minutes, I came up with the following items:  
- About me (general information about me as an individual in this cruel world)
  * Positive and negative personality traits
  * Hobbies
  * Personal details like age and name 
- Skills (soft and hard, just like my ...)
  * Programming languages
  * General behaviour in a social environment
- Projects (that's at least two)
  * Project name
  * Project description
  * Link to github / online demo
  * Preview image
  * Status of the poject (working on it, dropped it, completed)
- Contact info (for the stalkers out there)
  * I'll just make a form to send an email, I don't care
- Social media (professional and unprofessional)
  * LinkedIn
  * GitHub
  * Discord
  * MyAnimeList / AniList
- General images (to add some flare to the website)
  * Anime characters
  * Programming language logo's

## Design
After some "careful consideration" I landed on the following decisions.

### Colors
- Tangerine     : #F78702
- Dark charcoal : #333333
- Black         : #000000
- Cyan-blue     : #34495E
- Slate gray    : #708090

### Wireframes
I made the following wireframe so I can actually follow a layout instead of being dumb and sculpting everything without any idea.
